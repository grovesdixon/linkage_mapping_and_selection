linkage_mapping_and_selection
=============================

Pipeline for analyzing data from an artificial selection experiment.
A reciprocal cross was made between colonies of Acropora millepora.
Larval progeny were divided into replicate cohorts then submitted one of two treatments:
control conditions or heat selection.
The larvae were genotyped using 2bRAD for linkage mapping and testing for signitures of
selection by comparing allele frequencies between controls and heat selected groups.
